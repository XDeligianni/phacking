Tutorial by Dr. Xeni Deligianni-xenideligianni.com

This tutorial was created for the **mritogether** workshop.

You can run it from here: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/XDeligianni/phacking/HEAD?labpath=pHacking.ipynb

Or download and run the files in Rstudio.

It is meant as a guide to commonly made misconception and misuse of statistics and specifically t-test in MR research.

This is a general overview of typical misconceptions, not a statistics tutorial.

The motivation was to show what can happen when we blindly apply statistics.
