White hat' s guide to phacking (MRI together Dec 21)
# Dr Xeni Deligianni-xenideligianni.com

This tutorial was created for the mritogether.com workshop-December 2021

It is meant as a guide to commonly made misconception and misuse of statistics and specifically t-test in MR research.

This is a general overview, not a statistics tutorial.

The motivation was to show what can happen when we blindly apply statistics. 

Small mathematical mistakes are possible. Please contact the authors if you find any!
